## Overview 
This project examines how alterations in the gut microbiome influence brain pathways associated with appetite and behavior. Using 16S rRNA sequencing data from an activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model, We processed and analyzed microbial diversity using a reproducible DADA2 pipeline. These results lay the foundation for understanding microbiome-driven influences on hypothalamic gene expression.
